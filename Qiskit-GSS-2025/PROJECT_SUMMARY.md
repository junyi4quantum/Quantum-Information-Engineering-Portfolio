# Technical Summary of Qiskit Global Summer School Labs

This document provides a technical deep dive into the core concepts, mathematical formalism, and implementation strategies demonstrated across the Qiskit Global Summer School 2025 lab series.

## I. Quantum Circuit Design and Execution (Labs 0 & 1)

### A. GHZ State Generation (Lab 0)

The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is a maximally entangled state of $N$ qubits, often used as a benchmark.

The GHZ state is defined as:
|\text{GHZ}_N\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0\rangle^{\otimes N} + |1\rangle^{\otimes N} \right)

*   **Implementation:** The state is created by applying a Hadamard gate ($H$) to the first qubit to create a superposition, followed by a sequence of Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates between adjacent qubits to propagate the entanglement across the register.
*   **Hardware Execution:** The lab required utilizing the **Qiskit Runtime Service** to select a target quantum processing unit (QPU) and submit the transpiled circuit for real-time execution.

### B. Entanglement Verification (Lab 1)

Lab 1 verified quantum entanglement via the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, which is maximally violated by a Bell state.

*   **CHSH Metric:** The value of the $S$ parameter is calculated using measurement outcomes:
    $$
    S = E(a, b) - E(a, b') + E(a', b) + E(a', b')
    $$
    where $E(x, y)$ is the correlation function for measurements in bases $x$ and $y$.
*   **Quantum Prediction:** For a perfectly entangled Bell state, the maximum quantum mechanical prediction is $S = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828$. Any value $|S| > 2$ experimentally disproves Local Hidden Variables (LHV) theories.

## II. Variational Algorithms and Noise Mitigation (Lab 2)

### A. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for Max-Cut

The Max-Cut problem (finding a partition of a graph's vertices that maximizes the number of edges between partitions) is mapped to a quantum system via an Ising Hamiltonian.

*   **Hamiltonian Mapping:** The Max-Cut objective function $C$ is transformed into a cost Hamiltonian $H_C$:
    $$
    H_C = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} \frac{1}{2} (I - Z_i Z_j)
    $$
    where $Z_i$ is the Pauli $Z$ operator on qubit $i$. The solution corresponds to the ground state of $H_C$.
*   **QAOA Circuit:** The algorithm iteratively applies a Cost Operator $U(C, \gamma) = e^{-i\gamma H_C}$ and a Mixer Operator $U(B, \beta) = e^{-i\beta H_B}$, where $H_B = \sum_i X_i$.

### B. Hardware Optimization and Error Mitigation (Lab 2)

*   **Transpilation:** The lab focused on finding the optimal **qubit layout** (mapping logical qubits to physical qubits) using `qiskit.compiler.transpile` to match the circuit's connectivity with the device's coupling map, thereby minimizing expensive SWAP gates.
*   **Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE):** This error mitigation technique estimates the noiseless expectation value by running the circuit at various noise levels (via folding the circuit, e.g., $U \to UU^\dagger U$) and extrapolating the measured noisy results back to zero noise.

## III. Quantum Chemistry Simulation (Lab 3)

### A. Molecular Simulation Workflow:
The lab followed a standard quantum chemistry simulation workflow:
1. **Classical Pre-processing:** Calculating molecular integrals (one- and two-electron) for the $\text{N}_2$ molecule (using a specific basis set).
2. **Hamiltonian Construction:** Mapping the fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian (e.g., using the Jordan-Wigner transformation).
3. **Ground State Energy:** Finding the minimal eigenvalue of the resulting Hamiltonian.

### B. Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD):
SQD is an advanced method used to efficiently find the ground state energy.
*   **Concept:** Instead of sampling a full VQE ansatz, SQD uses 'good samples' (selected configuration states) to reconstruct a small, effective Hamiltonian that approximates the true ground state.
*   **Implementation:** The exercise involved implementing **Configuration Recovery**, where measurement outcomes from the quantum device are processed to enhance the signal and correct for noise-induced sampling errors, allowing accurate reconstruction of the Hamiltonian matrix elements.

## IV. Quantum Error Correction (Lab 4)

### A. Stabilizer Formalism and CSS Codes:
The fundamental tool for QEC is the stabilizer formalism.
*   **Stabilizer Group ($\mathcal{S}$):** A QEC code is defined by an Abelian subgroup $\mathcal{S}$ of the Pauli group that commutes with all operators in the group, and whose action on the encoded state is trivial. $\mathcal{S}$ is generated by a set of **stabilizer generators** ($\mathcal{S} = \langle g_1, g_2, \dots, g_{n-k} \rangle$).
*   **CSS Codes:** These codes (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) use separate stabilizers for bit-flip errors ($X$-type stabilizers) and phase-flip errors ($Z$-type stabilizers). The **Steane Code** ($[[7, 1, 3]]$) was explored as a benchmark CSS code.

### B. Advanced QEC Architecture (Lab 4):
The lab progressed to highly efficient architectures:
*   **Toric and QLDPC Codes:** The exercise required analyzing the parity check matrices for the **Toric Code** and a **Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) Gross Code** variant, particularly focusing on codes constructed on a 144-qubit lattice.
*   **Code Parameters:** The core objective was to determine the number of **logical qubits ($k$)** that can be encoded by these complex codes for a given number of physical data qubits ($n$). The comparison demonstrated how specialized code geometry can dramatically influence error correction performance (e.g., the superior distance of the Gross Code).
